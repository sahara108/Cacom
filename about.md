I am Tuan, a developer from Vietnam. I have been developing apps for iPhone and iPad since 2010. I also worked on Mac, Windows platforms. Be passionate in programming, I am not only research about familiar programming languages (such as ObjC, swift, c++ ...) but also look around how to do it better, quicker, more efficient. After every project, I always think about how I did it, can it be better, think about the pattern/architecture that I used and how can I improve it. Which part of the project I can automate using scripts. And I always keep going for a better solution.

Beside of what I did in my job, I also look at the trend of technology. And of course, I can't ignore the hottest trend, machine learning. I loved it. I am training my self to know more about it and try to use it for my favorite platform, iOS. It isn't really easy but I' keep going.
